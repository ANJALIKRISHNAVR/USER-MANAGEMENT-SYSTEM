# USER-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
A simple User Management Web App built using Angular, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to add names and marks, view a user list, calculate average marks, and delete entries. The app uses two-way binding, dynamic styling, and a tab-based interface. Marks are color-coded based on performance, and the UI is clean and responsive.
